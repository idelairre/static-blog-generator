# Static blog generator

Static blog generator inspired by Backbone. Allows you to organize static sites into components and display collection data (such as posts). Supports markdown and Jekyll/Hexo style posts.

# Why?

There are tons of static blog generators out there but I made this for a few reasons: their weird and opinionated organization and automagical code makes them hard to modify and reason about, Liquid templates are kind of ugly, and, at the moment, I prefer JavaScript and json to Ruby and YAML. See my post here: [link](https://idelairre.github.io/jekyll-is-broken).

# To do

+ Configure markdown processor to parse footnotes
+ Allow the use of custom css pre-processors like Less and Sass
+ Add RSS feed support
