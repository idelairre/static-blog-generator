All the descendants of a node have a common prefix of the string associated with that node, and the root is associated with the empty string.

For something like this I immediately want to know why it is called a bubble sort. Fortunately the good folks at wikibooks have an answer: \"The bubble sort gets its name because elements tend to move up into the correct order like bubbles rising to the surface.\"[^1] Interesting, so why does it have this behavior? The scary-smart brogrammer (who like myself could use some decent acne wash) who does the Harvard CS50 course explains: \"the right most elements are garaunteed to be in their correct place.\" He then takes the worst case scenario for sorting an array of numbers (the case that involves the most iterations) to demonstrate.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<p>If we have an array <code>[9, 6, 5, 3, 2]</code> and we iterate once then we have <code>[6, 9, 5, 3, 2]</code> on the next pass we have <code>[6, 5, 9, 3, 2]</code>. We can already see the <code>9</code> being passed to the right on each iteration so that it appears to \"bubble\" towards the right.</p>\n<p>On the next iteration we have <code>[6, 5, 3, 9, 2]</code> and finally <code>[6, 5, 3, 2, 9]</code>. On the next iteration it will start with <code>6</code> thus, <code>[5, 6, 3, 2, 9]</code> then <code>[5, 3, 6, 2, 9]</code> and so on. This is clearly a very \"expensive\" operation (least not indicated because it was very tedious to type all those iterations). As such, its run time O of n is On<sup>2</sup>, checking every element through each iteration.</p>\n<p><strong>Bubble sort in action:</strong>[^2]\n<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Bubble-sort-example-300px.gif\"></p>\n<p>A \"naive\" or simple sorting algorithm would check all the elements of the array. However, knowing that the right most element is already sorted allows for a slight optimization. One can optimize again with flags and counters. At risk of repeating everything our clever bro says in the movie, I'll allow you to check it out yourself.[^3] Also checkout wikipedia's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort#Optimizing_bubble_sort\">article on optimizing bubble sorts.</a></p>\n<h2>Merge Sort</h2>\n\n<p>A merge sort, as the name suggests, merges two sorted lists. Since there is a major time crunch on this assignment, I'll again stick closely to the CS50 examples (this time featuring a brogrammer in an American Eagle polo his mom probably got for him in high school, but my God is he sexy smart).</p>\n<p>Supposing you have two already sorted lists <code>[4, 15, 16, 50]</code> and <code>[8, 23, 42, 108]</code>, since they are already sorted (with the smallest elements at the left of the list) you can take each first element of the two lists and compare whether one is larger than the other. <code>4</code> is smaller so it  is entered as the first element of the new sorted list. The next task is to compare whether <code>8</code> is larger or smaller than <code>15</code>. Since <code>8</code> is smaller it enters the sorted list as the second element and so forth.</p>\n<p>The basic pseudo code for this sorting algorithm is to compare the first two elements of each list and remove the smaller of the two.</p>\n<p>On the first comparison you would have <code>[4, 8]</code> with the two remaining arrays being <code>[15, 16, 50]</code> and <code>[23, 42, 108]</code>.  On the second comparison you would have <code>[4, 8, 15, 16]</code> with the two remaining arrays being <code>[50]</code> and <code>[42, 108]</code>. On the third comparison you would have <code>[4, 8, 15, 16]</code> with the two remaining arrays being <code>[50]</code> and <code>[42, 108]</code> and so on.</p>\n<p>So after iterating through each list our final result would naturally be <code>[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, 50, 108]</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Merge sort in action:</strong>[^4]\n<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Merge_sort_animation2.gif/220px-Merge_sort_animation2.gif\"></p>\n<p>Assuming a less ideal situation where the same numbers are out of order in a single list, we need to adjust the algorithm. Here, our nerdcore brogrammer produces the list <code>[108, 15, 50, 4, 8, 42, 23, 16]</code>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>First we must split the lists in half until we have <i>n</i> number lists for <i>n</i> number elements: <code>[108][15][50][4][8][42][23][16]</code></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Step two uses basically the same algorithm as before: the first two elements of two given lists are compared and the smaller one is entered as the first element of a new sorted list until all lists are of size 2: <code>[15, 108][4, 50][8, 42][16, 23]</code></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Step three is to repeat this process until the lists are of size 4: <code>[4, 15, 50, 108][8, 16, 23, 42]</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Step four concludes the first pass by producing a single sorted list: <code>[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, 50, 108]</code></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So actually this is rather fast: O(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>). But  the speed trade off are its memory requirements since it has to make new lists and store them in memory. Further, the use cases for merge sort may be limited since they tend to become inefficient for lists larger than 50 and are not universally faster than other algorithms with all unsorted lists.</p>\n<p>If you somehow found this useful than I don't recommend watching the video, however, if you want to watch our brogrammers adorable blooper reel, definitely checkout the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeQ8pwjQxTM\">CS50 video</a>.</p>\n<h2>Insertion sort: the most phallogocentric sorting method</h2>\n\n<p>An insertion sort iterates through an unsorted list one element at a time, grabbing it and determining its correct position in the sorted array. This is done by determing if it is larger or smaller than the first element in the sorted list. If it larger, it compares itself against the next element in the list until it finds an element larger than itself, in this case, it inserts itself in front of that element.[^5]</p>\n<p>As such it is hardly an efficient algorithm. However, it can be faster than more advanced algorithms with very small data sets. Further, it is an incredibly simple program to write. Wikipedia notes that there is a three-line C version (which must be nothing short of a miracle).[^6] Another advantage is that the sorted list is always sorted since it always puts the new element in the right order.</p>\n<p><strong>insertion sort in action:</strong>[^7]\n<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Insertion-sort-example-300px.gif\"></p>\n<p>So much for insertion sort.</p>\n<h2>Quick sort</h2>\n\n<p><i>Note: this sort method is really difficult to explain so I feel it is best to start with its terms. In this instance I find it useful to \"bruteforce\" my understanding with a lot of different examples. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OLTJlwyIqQ\">This video</a> was particularly helpful.</i></p>\n<p><strong>quick sort terms:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>pivot: the element being sorted</li>\n<li>wall: the end of the list</li>\n<li>current element: leftmost element</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Firstly, it is important to note that all elements to the right of the wall are bigger than then the the elements to the left.</p>\n<p>Quick sort takes the \"pivot\" element and compares its size against the element against the \"wall\" to see if it is larger than it. If it isn't than it counts up the list until it finds such an element. When it finds it, it takes that element and puts it against the wall and takes the element previously against the wall and places it in the index of the swapped number, the wall then moves up to the next position in the list.</p>\n<p>If no other elements on the right side of the wall are larger then the algorithm takes the pivot element and swaps it with the first item to the right of the wall and the wall moves up accordingly.</p>\n<p>This algorithm is has the potential to be somewhat expensive in the worst, worst case scenario. Thus to increase the efficiency of this sort, one can use an inexpensive search to find the median value of the elements of the array to use as the pivot.[^8]</p>\n<p>Definitely check out this <a href=\"http://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/3/why-is-quicksort-better-than-other-sorting-algorithms-in-practice\">stack exchange post</a> if runtime and efficiency interests you.</p>\n<p><strong>quick sort:</strong>[^9]\n<img src=\"http://www.lisdn.com/attachments/2013/07/1_2013070813412612CE8.gif\"></p>\n<h2>Selection Sort</h2>\n\n<p>\"Selection sort is one way to sort an array of numbers. Data is divided into sorted and unsorted portions. One by one, the smallest values remaining in the unsorted portion are selected and swapped over to the sorted portion of the array.\"[^10]</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>First, scan the unsorted portion of the array to find the smallest value.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Swap that value with the first unsorted value -- it is now part of the sorted subarray.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Repeat until there are no more values in the unsorted portion of the array.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\"In both the best and worst cases, we'd have to compare each element to every other element in the unsorted subarray to ensure that the smallest value is selected on each iteration. As such, the selection sort algorithm takes n2 in the best and worst cases.\"<a href=\"ibid.\">^11</a></p>\n<p>Since the best and worst case runtimes of selection sort are equivalent, the expected runtime is Θ(n2)</p>\n<p><strong>selection sort in action:</strong>[^12]\n<img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Selection_sort_animation.gif/250px-Selection_sort_animation.gif\"></p>\n<p>[^1]: <a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Algorithm_Implementation/Sorting/Bubble_sort\">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Algorithm_Implementation/Sorting/Bubble_sort</a></p>\n<p>[^2]: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort#Analysis\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort#Analysis</a></p>\n<p>[^3]: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kp-8OGwphY\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kp-8OGwphY</a>.

In situations where system resources are scarce, the order of the data must be maintained and timeliness isn’t an issue, queues can be an appropriate way to process something like server requests.[^3]</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<p><strong>queue:</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/Data_Queue.svg\"></p>\n<h2>Stacks</h2>\n\n<p>Queues are similar to stacks (they are both sequential collections and linear data structures) with the primary difference being that a stack is a “Last-In-First-Out” (LIFO) as opposed to FIFO data structure. Or rephrased, all the operations on a stack are done at the end or back of the collection whereas in a queue they are performed at the front and back. Again rephrased, in a queue, operations on the first element are processed first whereas, in a stack, operations are performed on the last or most recently added element first. Stacks are also limited to two operations: “pushing” and “popping.” A push adds an element to a collection, whereas a pop removes the last element that was added. Stacks can be implemented when task priority is important (e.g., from a user experience standpoint, the most recent request to a server should be processed first) or the tasks are event-based (where certain event-based operations should be processed immediately rather than queued).</p>\n<p><strong>stack:</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/29/Data_stack.svg\"></p>\n<h2>Linked List</h2>\n\n<p>A more versatile data type (in the sense that operations can be performed at any place in the collection) is the linked list. Linked lists also possess the benefit that one does not need to specify a fixed size of the list (as is the case with arrays). As such it has more intuitive behavior than an array, i.e., adding elements to the list causes the list to get bigger. Since linked lists are comprised of nodes “linked” together in a sequence insertion and deletion can occur at any part of the collection by using the appropriate node as a reference (e.g., the C functions “insertBefore()” and “insertAfter()” which take a node as a parameter).[^4] Linked lists can also be copied, searched and or merged with other lists into a larger list. Each node (with the exception of the last element) possesses a reference which links it to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists can be linked in a linear (where the last element has “null” for a reference) or circular fashion (where the last element has a reference to the first or header node) and singly and doubly linked. Singly linked lists can only be traversed in one direction (left to right) whereas doubly linked lists can be traversed in any direction. Linked lists are a preferable data type when:</p>\n<li>time predictability is crucial since the O of n is constant</li>\n<li>you don’t need to index the values of the array\nwhen you don’t know how many items will be in your list</li>\n<li>when you need to insert items at any point in the list</li>\n\n<p><strong>linked list:</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://mike-lipman.com/images/linked-list.png\"></p>\n<p>[^1]: <a href=\"http://sdmeta.gforge.inria.fr/FreeBooks/Joy/11.pdf\">http://sdmeta.gforge.inria.fr/FreeBooks/Joy/11.pdf</a></p>\n<p>[^2]: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)</a></p>\n<p>[^3]: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7431054/when-where-how-should-queues-be-used\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7431054/when-where-how-should-queues-be-used</a></p>\n<p>[^4]: <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=NdVS88muul4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false\">https://books.google.com/books?id=NdVS88muul4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false\"</a></p>\n","excerpt":"<p><i>Note: Most of this information was gained from a basic Google search and is presented here for the sake of distilling some basic concepts of computer science into an easily understandable form.

Not so hard, right?</p>\n<h2 id=\"problems-immediately-module-loading\">Problems immediately: module loading</h2>\n<p>I found an Angular 1 es6 starter repo and began my genius work of copying and pasting their webpack configuration wholesale, splitting the views and controllers into components, adding import and export statements and glancing at documentation. When everything was mostly in order, I decided to bring the app back to life one piece at a time in the router and immediately into this gloriously descriptive error:</p>\n<pre><code>angular.js:68Uncaught Error: [$injector:modulerr] Failed to instantiate module pollingApp due to:\nError: [$injector:modulerr] Failed to instantiate module {\"_invokeQueue\":[],\"_configBlocks\":[],\"_runBlocks\":[],\"requires\":[\"edit\",\"login\",\"main\",\"nav\",\"result\",\"survey\"],\"name\":\"components\"} due to:\nError: [ng:areq] Argument 'module' is not a function, got Object\n</code></pre><p>Angular's error messages are terrible. This error, back in the day, was thrown if a module's array of dependencies was malformed but with es6 modules it adds a layer of confusion. A Google search of this exact problem will produce not a lot in the way of how or why this is the case. Although you may come across <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30794824/error-ngareq-argument-module-is-not-a-function-got-object\">this stack exchange post</a>.</p>\n<p>It turns out Angular modules are not CommonJS modules at all and that you have to export a module's <code>name</code> attribute so Angular can handle it with its internal module system. Has this always been the case? Bizarre.</p>\n<p><em>Note: this issue applies to a number of Angular libraries as well. If you've ever wondered indefinitely whether to load the module then add it as a string to your angular module dependencies or to import a variable and add that to your dependencies or import a variable and then add its <code>name</code> attribute to your dependencies this is why. However, it looks like a few major libraries are on board with supporting es6 modules, e.g. <a href=\"https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/issues/2506\">ui-router</a></em></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-official-component-router-is-broken\">The official component router is broken</h2>\n<p>Components. Are. Great. Components are the future (nevermind that Angular components somewhat resemble Backbone views). Refactoring old Angular controllers and views into components is not too difficult, --even an enjoyable, task. However, it may not be immediately apparent how these new components jive with Angular's router(s) (there are currently three official routers). At this time, they don't, at least officially, since <a href=\"(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33652668/angular-1-5-and-new-component-router\">the new component router has been deprecated and they are working on a new API</a>).</p>\n<p>Whatever the state of Angular's router, the new UI-router (angular-ui-router@1.0.0-beta.1) handles components beautifully with a very simple api. It needs little in the way of explanation:</p>\n<pre><code>const routes = function($stateProvider, $urlRouterProvider) {\n  /* @ngInject */\n\n  $stateProvider\n    .state('edit', {\n      url: '/edit',\n      component: 'editComponent'\n  });\n\n  $stateProvider\n    .state('main', {\n      url: '/main',\n      component: 'mainComponent'\n  });\n\n  $stateProvider\n    .state('result', {\n      url: '/result',\n      component: 'resultComponent'\n  });\n\n  $urlRouterProvider.otherwise('main');\n}\n\nexport default routes;\n</code></pre><p>It is clear this is the solution for component routing at this time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-not-ng-forward-or-ng-metadata-\">Why not ng-forward or ng-metadata?</h2>\n<p>Interesting. I spent a fair amount of time working on two ng-forward projects with the intent to carry them over to Angular 2. It is true that ng-forward handles a lot of Angular's weirdness in terms of module loading (it automagically handles and loads the <code>name</code> attribute when you load your dependencies). I found that I could think in pure JavaScript more frequently, break away from Angular's services (like <code>$http</code>) and use vanilla JS libraries, and used those projects to explore making decorators and using other es6-7 features. However, two points made using ng-forward a deal breaker:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>not one of the components I made for those projects, as far as I am aware, is usable by a pure Angular app.</li>\n<li>I was still unable to escape the need to manipulate the <code>$scope</code> digest cycle.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thus, they are weird mutant apps that will probably never make it to Angular 2 since they rely on libraries programmed \"in and for Angular\" like Angular Material and UI-Bootstrap and are not backward compatible with Angular 1. The fact that <a href=\"https://github.com/ngUpgraders/ng-forward/issues/174\">ng-forward is no longer maintained</a> was the nail in the coffin. The only hope for the future of these apps is that Angular 2 versions of their current UI frameworks will become mature enough for me to refactor my app with them--starting the cycle of dependency anew.</p>\n<p>Ng-metadata more strongly prohibits developers from doing things like manipulating the digest cycle (by simple making it not available). As a framework, it is much more disciplinary since the Typescript requirement makes the addition of third-party libraries a more costly decision. However, ng-metadata added too much overhead for a simple quiz app.</p>\n<p>As an aside, ng-metadata so thoroughly imitates Angular 2, I can't see a reason to use it instead of actually making an Angular 2 app.</p>\n<p>Angular 1 components are robust enough even without es6 classes, decorators and other sugar. In fact, they solve many of the problems that have plagued the framework by isolating their responsibility to their view and data (e.g., their scope is isolated, they have \"well defined\" life-cycle hooks so there is no question of whether a controller or directive should handle view logic first, they have a \"well defined\" api so you aren't trying to piece together what a model looks like from html templates and controller code, etc...) and allowing developers to organize their apps according to a component hierarchy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"minification-is-still-a-problem\">Minification is still a problem</h2>\n<p>When it came time to deploy, I had all but forgotten this famous gotcha. Do not mangle your variable names when you minify your JavaScript.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wrap-up\">Wrap up</h2>\n<p>Angular is still a bear. I find its template syntax to be awkward, its directives cumbersome, and I don't like how it imperializes my way of thinking and programming (i.e., I don't like how there is an \"angular version\" of everything or an \"angular way of doing\" this or that). However, if I need a project or prototype working by myself in like two days, Angular is still my goto framework.</p>\n<p>Besides these and a few other \"gotchas\" building a quick and dirty Angular 1 app in 2016 is a fast and enjoyable experience. Components are like Angular on easy mode and really reduce the intellectual overhead of using the framework. My main gripe is still modules and dependency injection. Perhaps at one point, in the days of global variables and script tags, Angular's DI was a necessary solution but now it seems cumbersome and arcane. Hopefully, Angular 1 will further simplify.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I saw some haughtily titled articles (<a href=\"https://medium.com/javascript-and-opinions/state-of-the-art-javascript-in-2016-ab67fc68eb0b#.i9nbs2snf\">The State of Javascript in 2016</a> by Francois Ward and <a href=\"https://medium.com/@sachagreif/the-state-of-javascript-front-end-frameworks-1a2d8a61510#.wixfq9jkh\">The State of Javascript: Front-End Frameworks</a> by Sacha Greif) and they struck me.

Some of the comparisons are arbitrary, e.g., comparing Angular to jQuery, but most of these pieces are well considered. <a href=\"http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2015/01/the_problem_wit.html\">\"The Problem with Angular\"</a> is particularly interesting because it reveals Angular's paradoxical design motivations, which I see as the heart of the matter.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<h2 id=\"angular-was-never-meant-for-front-end-developers\">Angular was never meant for front-end developers</h2>\n<p>Evidently Angular was made for designers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When AngularJS was first created, almost five years ago, it was not originally intended for developers. It was a tool targeted more at designers who needed to quickly build persistent HTML forms. Over time it has changed to accommodate a variety of scenarios and developers have picked it up and used it to build more and more complex applications. - Rob Eisenberg</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Interesting. If Angular does one thing well, its forms and validation. An excellent use-case for Angular is an application with a large amount of forms. However, templates with very little restriction on what logic you can use, combined with invisible models that must be divined from said templates, combined with its module loader plunges the hapless developer into a private hell. Directives like <code>ng-if</code> and <code>ng-repeat</code> clutter your templates and Angular's weird prejudice against compiling html or controlling view logic in controllers often mean you will have tons of inline code. Encapsulating and hiding this logic in smaller directives and components is desirable but allows Angular to appear superficially clean.</p>\n<p>Consider input masks, for instance, the logic behind making a simple mask in Angular is fairly complex considering that you must use two apis (<code>directive</code> and <code>filter</code>). However, the real pain point will be getting your directive to use your filter since directives must be defined using three very complex methods, namely <code>compile</code>, <code>link</code>, <code>controller</code>, which themselves expose various complex objects like <code>$scope</code>, <code>$element</code>, <code>$attrs</code>, <code>$formatter</code>, <code>$parser</code>, etc. Meanwhile, the api for interfacing with a model or other directives through the <code>require</code> property is marred by opaque syntax for locating controllers (wtf are <code>^</code>, <code>?</code>, <code>^?</code> supposed to mean?). The grunt work of writing a directive is configuring and declaring methods on a bunch of properties that do not seem to resemble the JavaScript entities you are trying to manipulate. This is a deeply unintuitive process.</p>\n<p>As, mnemon1ck notes in his article <a href=\"https://medium.com/@mnemon1ck/why-you-should-not-use-angularjs-1df5ddf6fc99#.jq15wqim5\">\"Why you should not use Angularjs\"</a>, the api for directives is massive: <a href=\"https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$compile#!\">link</a> and causes no end of problems considering the number of questions on StackExchange.</p>\n<p>Beyond the most simple forms and validations. Creating directives is a deeply confusing and fails to resemble doing anything in JavaScript. Angular seems almost like another language. Its prejudice against DOM manipulation (which is shared by React and other frameworks but handled much more gracefully by them) has led to a bizarre and sprawling directive api. What was the motivation behind this api?</p>\n<h2 id=\"angular-was-meant-for-back-end-java-programmers\">Angular was meant for back-end Java programmers</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Angular is aimed at large enterprise IT back-enders and managers who are confused by JavaScript’s insane proliferation of tools. [...] Enterprise IT managers also like the fact that Angular closely mirrors the preferences of their back-end developers. I had an illuminating Twitter conversation with Joe Pearson of weather.com, who told me that they had recently switched to Angular, mostly for the sake of their Java developers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is revealing, however this notion that Angular was made for IT professionals who wanted an opinionated framework in the face of endless JavaScript libraries and design patterns conflicts with the claim that it was made for designers. If both these statements are true than this tension is built into Angular's design.</p>\n<p>Lets step back.</p>\n<p>At this stage, there is really no need for Angular's \"opinionated\" proprietary services like <code>$http</code> and <code>$resource.</code> While <code>$http</code> is not bad, it does exactly what it needs to do, adding it as a dependency in an es6 class is kind of a drag since you will end up writing <code>$http</code> about three times before you can use it. Using a library like Axios becomes preferable here. <code>$resource</code>, however, is a real time waster, after a refactor, I found that the entities that <code>$resource</code> creates don't behave like normal JavaScript objects and I had to slice them out of arrays, assign their properties to normal objects and all kinds of other gymnastics to get them to behave correctly. Why bother with this when you could make them function like Backbone models or even vanilla JS objects?</p>\n<p>However, in terms of developer ergonomics, after messing around with making an Android app, a \"mature\" Angular app that makes extensive use of directives and components seems to have the same expressiveness as xml. Passing variables into your components through html attributes is a real strength of Angular, however, this is where the benefits of inspiration from xml and Java ends.</p>\n<p>The declarative and somewhat paranoid syntax of Java is not really suited to JavaScript. Angular 1 was not really going in this direction with the exception of its paranoid use of dependency injection. But the transition to TypeScript Angular 2 has made and the extensive use of decorators really smells of Java. The workflow for building Angular 2 apps in TypeScript with an advanced IDE really feels like programming in Java. Here I'm referring to the overhead of using a strongly typed compiled language, i.e., Java's policy of making you program with a nit-picky secretary that is always asking \"Are you sure you meant to do that?\". Programming in TypeScript and Java can feel like typing with boxing gloves on.</p>\n<p>But I digress, a framework that is meant to simultaneously satisfy back-end Java developers and web designers is going to be an absolute clusterfuck.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-good\">The good</h2>\n<p>By now its clear that Google had some conflicting design principles and some contempt and maybe condescension towards JavaScript's more unstructured functional way of doing things. But what are the advantages of \"Angular's way of doing things\"?</p>\n<p>Off the bat, I can say that Angular lays out exactly what you can do to a thing. When I came to Angular as a newbie developer, I had no idea what JavaScript's capabilities were, I didn't know that certain things were possible. The directive API, despite being a mess, describes and structures how you can manipulate objects. For better or for worse, it railroads you into solving problems and thinking about things in its scoped and particular way. Had I begun building directives and components rather than full webapps I might have been better off as a developer. Then again, I started Angular before the component api was added, so I was accosted with the full brunt of Angular's design problems from the start.</p>\n<p>I usually only came to directives when I had a problem or a requirement that wasn't satisfied with existing libraries, which is a testament to the adaptability of Angular and the cumulative experience of its community. Of course, this is programming on easy mode and one does not cultivate an adventurous problem solver™ spirit. It also made those moments of digging around in the guts of directives without full knowledge of how they worked a deeply confusing and hellish task.</p>\n<p>But my attitude then and now is \"Hey, if you need something built fast, I can do it in Angular.\"</p>\n<h2 id=\"verdict-angular-is-decent-for-rapid-prototyping-small-projects\">Verdict: Angular is decent for rapid prototyping/small projects</h2>\n<p>I've come across this claim before and I buy it. From personal experience (4 projects in Angular, 2 of which are production apps), if you have more than 8 views and 12 components in your app you have reached your limit with Angular. This might sound small or arbitrary, but by this time your app will have a bunch of services, filters, and directives floating around in there, you will have a relatively deep component tree, your view templates will be getting tangled, and you will be running into Angular specific performance problems. Another good indication that \"you need to stop\" is if you are messing with the <code>$scope</code> digest cycle and manually assigning watchers, you are now fighting the framework and its time to reconsider what you are doing or move to something more flexible.</p>\n<p>This is a critical moment, you either want to get out now and salvage all your non-Angular code, transition to Angular 2 if you want to keep betting on Google (which will be expensive and hard), or freeze your app's dependencies and consider it \"done\" (i.e., commit heresy and wait until your app stops working in contemporary browsers). Google has not left users with much of a choice and my feeling is that they jumped the gun on a useful and <a href=\"https://idelairre.github.io/the-state-of-angular-1-in-2016\">relatively healthy framework</a> with a lot of potential by avoiding hard design decisions and starting over.</p>\n<p>My most recent project, which was small, tightly scoped, and made heavy use of forms, left me feeling \"Hey, that wasn't so bad\" since it played to Angular's strengths. My big projects that I'm slowly transitioning to Angular 2 by using ng-forward and ng-upgrade have left me feeling near-suicidal. I have an Angular/electron app that is particularly painful to work on and I imagine people who made Cordova apps in Angular are feeling similar pains. Take it for what its worth.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I've been booting up some old Angular projects and found myself running into retrospectives on Angular and numerous articles about \"Why Angular will fail\", e.g., <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/tdd/5ba48ba5a2a179f2d0fa\">\"Angular, just say no\"</a> which explains \"why you should avoid the entire thing at all costs unless you want to spend the next few years in hell.\" The points these articles make about Angular's somewhat unstructured development, changing goals, audience and requirements are interesting.
